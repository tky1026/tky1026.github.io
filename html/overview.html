      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. 
        C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. 
        This C++ tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of C++ for beginners.

        <h2>Hello World</h2>
        <p>C++ is a super set of C programming with additional implementation of object-oriented concepts.</p>
        <p>Here is a conventional C++ Hello World program.</p>
        <pre><code>
          <preprocessor>#include</preprocessor> <string>&lt;iostream&gt;</string>

        <h2>Why to Learn C++</h2>
        <p>Some of the key advantages of learning C++:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development.</li>
          <li>C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.</li>
          <li>C++ is one of the ever green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers.</li>
          <li>C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest of software developmen</li>
          <li>C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of C++ Programming</h2>
        <p>C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages. It has it's presence in almost every area of software development.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Application Software Development</strong>
             - C++ programming has been used in developing almost all the major Operating Systems like Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. Apart from the operating systems, the core part of many browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Chrome have been written using C++. C++ also has been used in developing the most popular database system called MySQL.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Programming Languages Development</strong>
             - C++ has been used extensively in developing new programming languages like C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, UNIXâ€™s C Shell, PHP and Python, and Verilog etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Computation Programming</strong>
             - C++ is the best friends of scientists because of fast speed and computational efficiencies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Games Development</strong>
            - C++ is extremely fast which allows programmers to do procedural programming for CPU intensive functions and provides greater control over hardware, because of which it has been widely used in development of gaming engines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Embedded System</strong>
            - C++ is being heavily used in developing Medical and Engineering Applications like softwares for MRI machines, high-end CAD/CAM systems etc.

        <h2>C++ Overview</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.</li>
          <li>C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.</li>
          <li>C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note-tip"><strong>Note:</strong> A programming language is said to use static typing when type checking is performed during compile-time as opposed to run-time.</p>

        <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
        <p>C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inheritance</li>
          <li>Encapsulation</li>
          <li>Polymorphism</li>
          <li>Data abstraction</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Standard Libraries</h3>
        <p>Standard C++ consists of three important parts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The core language giving all the building blocks including variables, data types and literals, etc.</li>
          <li>The C++ Standard Library giving a rich set of functions manipulating files, strings, etc.</li>
          <li>The Standard Template Library (STL) giving a rich set of methods manipulating data structures, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The ANSI Standard</h3>
        <p>The ANSI standard is an attempt to ensure that C++ is portable; that code you write for Microsoft's compiler will compile without errors, using a compiler on a Mac, UNIX, a Windows box, or an Alpha.</p>
        <p>The ANSI standard has been stable for a while, and all the major C++ compiler manufacturers support the ANSI standard.</p>
        <p>There are many C++ compilers available, for example: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Apple C++. Xcode</li>
          <li>Bloodshed Dev-C++</li>
          <li>Clang C++</li>
          <li>Cygwin (GNU C++)</li>
          <li>MINGW - "Minimalist GNU for Windows"</li>
          <li>GNU CC source</li>
          <li>IBM C++</li>
          <li>Intel C++</li>
          <li>Microsoft Visual C++</li>
          <li>Oracle C++</li>
          <li>HP C++</li>
        </ul>
        <p>and many more ...</p>
